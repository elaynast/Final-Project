# Final-Project
Hello!
This is my final project for STA 518. I have my presentation, my individual shiny apps, and data sets used for this project. Even though the semester iis ending, this is still a working progress. I'd like to be able to add a legend to my line chart and my shiny app within my presentation does not work unless I manually enter in a new link for it eveyr day. Please comment any feedback if you know how to do any of that stuff based off my code and please enjoy!
